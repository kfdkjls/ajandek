Hence the name, we encrypt every pixel of your important files. How do I get my files back? How encryption works, is there is a private key that holds all of your files. If you type the private key into the msgbox below, your files will decrypt. The only way you can get your files back is if you buy 10 Dormi Chocolate bars, package them, ship them to my address, and send the tracking link to pixelocker0.0.1.6@gmail.hu. After, I will call you with steps on how to remove this virus. Have a nice day! -Pixelocker","Pixelocker 0.0.1.6","Decryption key here (once you get it)")
